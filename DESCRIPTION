Description: The package provides an efficient approach to generating random samples 
    from a multivariate normal distribution. It includes various algorithms and optimization 
    techniques, such as AR1-based Cholesky decomposition and RcppArma for high-performance 
    matrix computations. The package is designed for both ease of use and computational 
    efficiency.
